            I really think that collaboration is the answer... I love OpenSource
            projects and collaborate with a lot of them! I love Python, but I
            have no prejudices about other OpenSource tools.

            Now I'm bringing to Brazil

            <a target="_blank" href="https://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a>,
            because kids need to now how to programming. It's the future! Look what 
            I started here: <a target="_blank" href="http://coderdojorio.com.br">CoderDojo Rio</a>

            I like kids, dogs, soccer, sports (but I don't
            practice by now...), drink a beer with friends and my girl. Yeah!
            I love my friends and family (including my dog).
