        <h3>
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pentaho.com/">Pentaho</a>, the best BI (business intelligence) tool
        </h3>
        <p>
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pentaho.com/">Pentaho</a> is a great open source drag and drop tool for
            automated process but include some repeated jobs when you're
            creating these automated processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            It enables you to create tasks called transformations and group these tasks in jobs with a tool
            called PDI (Pentaho Data Integration).
            In addition, you can use a tool called Report Designer to make some reports based in data sources.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pentaho.com/">Pentaho</a> is really beautiful and help too much some tasks
            and ETL (extract, transform and load) processes, but
            when you need to change database for these transformations, jobs and reports is really difficult! You must open
            each of them and change database by hand! As follows:
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, lets imagine change by hand connections for each <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pentaho.com/">Pentaho</a> Job like this:
        </p>
        <img alt="Pentaho Job" src="/images/pentaho_jobs.png" />
        <p>
            With a lot of transformations like this:

            Avoiding 'Click and Change' <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pentaho.com/">Pentaho</a> repeated jobs
        </h3>
        <p>
            Programmers (and I think all people) hate repeated jobs (or should hate). These jobs are really boring
            and nobody should do these things. Automated processes improve company performance and enrich your
            employees skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only companies need automated process. Smart houses, cars and cities are here to make sure that
            people don't need to do some repeated tasks like turn off lights or detect cars crashes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Smart things are getting up new innovations and for company process we have some tools as
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bonitasoft.com/">BonitaBPM</a> for organize processes and
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pentaho.com/">Pentaho</a> for automate them, but who helps
            programmers to automate processes with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pentaho.com/">Pentaho</a>?
        </p>
        <p>
            To take care of this, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kappius/">Kappius Company Team</a> did
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kappius/pentaho-db-changer">Pentaho DB Changer</a> that can
            change dynamically database connections for transformations, jobs and reports from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pentaho.com/">Pentaho</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            With <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kappius/pentaho-db-changer">Pentaho DB Changer</a> you can change
            XML files with extensions: .ktr (transformations), .kjb (jobs) and .xml (reports), but for reports you need to unzip
            .prpt file and change datasources\sql-ds.xml file. Here is sections that XML file should have to
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kappius/pentaho-db-changer">Pentaho DB Changer</a> works:

            To avoid <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pentaho.com/">Pentaho</a> code
            changes and simplify future code compatibility with
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kappius/pentaho-db-changer">Pentaho DB Changer</a>
            we designed <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kappius/pentaho-db-changer">Pentaho DB Changer</a>
            with a decoupled approach that can be used as a Python module instead of just executed.
