        <h3>
            What?? My free website?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Yeah! You don't need to pay for a simple website or you portfolio. I
            did this website totally free (I just need to pay about 10 dollars
            yearly for my domain).
        </p>
        <p>
            It's really strange because people (mainly IT people) love databases
            and dynamic content with a lot of complexity. So, I'm here to change
            your mind. SOMETIMES YOU DON'T NEED COMPLEXITY! Databases and
            dynamic content are really powerful tools, but they allow some bugs
            and concerns that you don't want when you are building a simple website.

            What you will see right now is a transgression to all technology
            enforces and a new way of seeing this technology.

            When you make your personal blog or website a tool like
            <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/">>Wordpress</a>, you
            are saying to the world: "I need to spend money!".
            <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/">>Wordpress</a> is an
            amazing tool, but using it to make your personal blog is like kill an
            ant with a bazooka. You're using 0.1% of <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/">>Wordpress</a>
            and you did a giant infrastructure for it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's compare it with
            <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">>Github Pages</a>.
            <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">>Github Pages</a> is a
            service of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">>Github</a> where
            you can host static pages for your projects, for you and for your organizations.
            Every developer should open an account at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">>Github</a>
            because it's a spectacular collaboration environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ok, ok, I can host a static page, but... I need a blog, and contact form.
            How do that? So, if you think, every dynamic page displays static pages
            dynamically. Static pages are "Rock Stars" twenty years ago and now
            people don't mind them... Let's try to convince you that static pages
            are cool!
