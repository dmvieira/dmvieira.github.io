        <h3>
            Programmers reading and writing instead of coding?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Yeah guys, we need to know how to write! I'm Brazilian, and I listen from some of
            friends of mine:

        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Wow, I'm a programmer! I do some code and I don't need
            to know how to write in portuguese!
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Ok, let's imagine that you're coding for a brazilian company and you need to comment
            some code for your colleagues. Or even if you need to write an email to your manager.
            I don't know what your manager will think about it, but it's a fair skill for your
            promotion...
        </p>
        <p>
            If that guy don't mind about writing in portuguese, imagine in english! If you want a
            better job or submit a paper for scientific area with your results or new implementation
            you must write in english!
        </p>
        <h3>
            I understood about a better job, but write a paper?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Everyone can write a paper with innovations for scientific community. But I think
            this is not the question here... Programmers can do fantastic things because they
            know how to make ideas come true with coding!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you think that you have a good idea look inside <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a>
            if someone made this idea yet. If not go and build! There are a lot of conferences that you
            can submit your paper. You will get a lot of pride and recognition in community.
        </p>
        <h3>
            And read? For what?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The more you read, the more you write better... Simple as that... But please, read good references!
            Facebook and Twitter sometimes have a lot of errors and typos, so be careful and use
            <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> as much as you can.
        </p>
        <h3>
            My own story...
        </h3>
        <p>
            Nowadays I submitted a paper to <a target="_blank" href="http://icc2015.ieee-icc.org/">IEEE ICC</a>
            (International Conference On Communications) that is a great conference in the Great Britain!
            My paper is "Content Recommendation and Service Costs in Swarming Systems" that I did in MSc about
            how Recommendation Systems can improve QoE (Quality of Experience) in VoD (Video over Demand) and live
            streaming over P2P (peer-to-peer) scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
            This conference want to make word smarter and my paper try to make content delivery smarter, so it's
            matching! When you search for a conference or a journal to submit your paper, before get in mind if
            your work is good for that conference. If it matches don't be afraid! Go and submit it!!
